# Post-Disaster Communication System

This project aims to enable reliable message delivery after a disaster, especially in areas without internet access. Mobile devices can create and send four types of emergency messages using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi. These messages are stored locally and forwarded to nearby devices when a connection is available. Messages spread from device to device. Once any device gains internet access, it uploads all the collected messages to a central server.

The web interface displays these messages on a map, where they can also be marked as "help delivered" when necessary.

## Emergency Message Types

- Search & Rescue
- Medical Assistance
- Supply Request
- "I'm Alive" Notification
